The ROC curve shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. An AUC close to 1.0 indicates excellent classification performance, even under threshold variations.

### Precision-Recall Curve

![Precision_recall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b487eaab-a008-484a-926e-3d525aa0e0aa)

This curve highlights the modelâ€™s ability to maintain high precision and recall, especially important for imbalanced datasets where false negatives are costly in medical diagnostics.

### Average Inference Time

  36.89 ms/image
  
  The model achieves fast inference, making it viable for real-time or clinical deployment on GPU-based systems.
